# Siddik Ayyappa Naraharisetti

Hey there, I am [Siddik Ayyappa](http://sites.google.com/view/siddikayyappa/). I am a junior student at [IIITH](https://www.iiit.ac.in).

My Interests:
-  Machine Learning
- Deep Learning (My New favourite)
- Full Stack Web development

I also like programming questions, they sharpen my mind all the time. I see them as a good excercise to the mind. I solve problems on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/siddikAyyappa11/) daily. I have been maintaining my streak. I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC60H_ZGy1DDqJUeO0f10HHA), do check it out for the projects I have worked on, sometimes, I make a demo of them.
